# Nightfall Reworked (Mobile)
Nightfall Reworked is the mobile adaptation of the previously discontinued JAVA CLI game, Nightfall. The previous game can be accessed within my GitHub.

**No Releases** at the moment.

The Game is open source, feel free to download the Unity Project and modify it to your liking, if you wish to contribute, do contact me through my [email](ahimaz.joshua@gmail.com).

## The Game.

Nightfall's main purpose is to Survive the horror's of RNG (Random Number Generation) while managing your settlement. This includes the food supply, materials, settlers status, scavenging, building and protecting from attacks and the forces of nature.

The player will eventually lose, with the many changes of random occurences throughout the game, with the inclusion of a very small percentage that the settlement will get nuked. (End game unless a bunker is built).

As the game progresses in development, an android build will be available as well as new features on the game's [Wiki (In Development)](#).
